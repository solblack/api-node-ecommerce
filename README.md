# api-node-ecommerce

API for an eCommerce made using Express framework

-   Run "npm install" or "npm i" to install dependencies

-   To start the server, run "npm run start". This will run the command "nodemon app.js --exec babel-node --". This project uses ES6, so Babel and Nodemon will be needed to run the app.

-   The API is currently using a JSON file to handle mock data.

-   To check the documentation for this API, go to http://localhost:3000 (after starting the server)
